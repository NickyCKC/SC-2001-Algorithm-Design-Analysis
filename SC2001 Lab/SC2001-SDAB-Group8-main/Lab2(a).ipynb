    "2. Main loop\n",
    "   a. Finding the minimum distance vertex\n",
    "   b. Updating distances\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initialization:\n",
    "- We initialize the `dist` and `visited` arrays.\n",
    "- Time complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Main Loop:\n",
    "The main loop runs V times, once for each vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Finding the minimum distance vertex:\n",
    "- We iterate through all vertices to find the unvisited vertex with the minimum distance.\n",
    "- Time complexity per iteration: O(V)\n",
    "- Total time complexity for this step: O(V) * O(V) = O(V²)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Updating distances:\n",
    "- For each selected vertex, we check all possible neighbors (all V vertices in an adjacency matrix).\n",
    "- Time complexity per iteration: O(V)\n",
    "- Total time complexity for this step: O(V) * O(V) = O(V²)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worst Case:\n",
    "Total time complexity: O(V) + O(V²) = O(V²)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Case:\n",
    "The average case for Dijkstra's algorithm with an adjacency matrix and array-based priority queue is also O(V²). This is because regardless of the graph's structure, we always perform the same number of operations:\n",
    "- We always check all V vertices to find the minimum distance vertex.\n",
    "- We always check all V potential edges for each vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Case:\n",
    "Even in the best case scenario (e.g., a graph where all vertices are directly connected to the source with no other edges), the time complexity remains O(V²). This is because:\n",
    "- We still initialize all data structures: O(V)\n",
    "- We still go through the main loop V times: O(V)\n",
    "- In each iteration, we still check all V vertices to find the minimum: O(V)\n",
    "- We still check all potential edges for each vertex: O(V)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the best case is also O(V²).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of this implementation can be broken down as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adjacency Matrix: O(V²)\n",
    "   - The graph is represented as a V x V matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Distance Array: O(V)\n",
    "   - We store a distance value for each vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Visited Array: O(V)\n",
    "   - We keep track of visited status for each vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Other Variables: O(1)\n",
    "   - A constant amount of space for loop variables and temporary storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Space Complexity: O(V²) + O(V) + O(V) + O(1) = O(V²)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant factor is the adjacency matrix, which requires O(V²) space regardless of the number of edges in the graph. This makes the implementation memory-intensive for large graphs, especially sparse ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the space requirements for different graph sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For V = 100:\n",
    "   Space ≈ 100² * 4 bytes (assuming 32-bit integers) = 40,000 bytes ≈ 39 KB\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For V = 1,000:\n",
    "   Space ≈ 1,000² * 4 bytes = 4,000,000 bytes ≈ 3.8 MB\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For V = 10,000:\n",
    "   Space ≈ 10,000² * 4 bytes = 400,000,000 bytes ≈ 381 MB\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the space requirement grows quadratically with the number of vertices, which can become prohibitive for very large graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this Dijkstra's algorithm implementation is O(V²) in all cases (worst, average, and best) due to the use of an adjacency matrix and array-based priority queue. The space complexity is also O(V²), primarily due to the adjacency matrix representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this implementation is simple and can be efficient for small to medium-sized dense graphs, it may not be the best choice for large graphs or sparse graphs. For such cases, an implementation using an adjacency list and a more efficient priority queue (like a binary heap) would be more appropriate, potentially reducing the time complexity to O((V + E) log V) and the space complexity to O(V + E)."
